            <p class="mb-0">The term <strong><em>"vegan"</em></strong> was coined in 1944 by a small group of vegetarians who broke away from the Leicester Vegetarian Society to form the Vegan Society. These people chose not to consume dairy, eggs or any other products of animal origin, in addition to not eating meat like the vegetarians. Therefore, they felt the need to form a society that better represented their views. The term vegan was chosen by combining the first and last letters of the word vegetarian. Veganism was originally defined as "the principle of emancipation of animals from exploitation by man." In 1979, the Vegan Society became a registered charity and updated that definition. Veganism is defined as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, be it for food, clothing or any other purpose.</p>

          <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded">
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>For Ethical Reasons: </strong>  Ethical vegans avoid meat and animal agriculture products because they believe in an animal's freedom and right to a harm-free life. Aside from their dietary restrictions, most vegans will avoid leather items (shoes, coats, purses, belts). They also seek out alternatives to beauty products and cosmetics manufactured by companies that use animals for testing.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>For Health: </strong>  Dietary vegans avoid eating meat, eggs and dairy to improve health, prolong life, lose weight or lower disease risk.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>For the Environment: </strong>  Some vegans choose to avoid consuming animal products in an attempt to reduce their environmental footprint. Corporate cattle farming, for instance, is a big reason for deforestation in the southern hemisphere.</p>
